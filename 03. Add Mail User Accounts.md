This example is for the case you use OS user accounts.
Configure basic Postfix settings, and basic Dovecot settings first. 

 	To use OS user accounts, that's only adding OS user like follows.

Install mail client program

    [root@mail ~]# dnf -y install s-nail

Set environment variables to use Maildir

    [root@mail ~]# echo 'export MAIL=$HOME/Maildir' >> /etc/profile.d/mail.sh

# add a user [mailman]
    
    [root@mail ~]# useradd mailman
    
    [root@mail ~]# passwd mailman

Login as a user added in [1] and try to send an email.

    # send to myself [mail (username)@(hostname)]

    [mailman@mail ~]$ mail mailman@localhost    
    # input subject
    Subject: Test Mail#1
    # input messages
    This is the first mail.
    
    # to finish messages, push Ctrl + D key
